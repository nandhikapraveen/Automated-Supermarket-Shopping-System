# Smart-basket-for-retail-supermarket

RFID-enabled Baskets: The system includes specially designed shopping baskets that are embedded with RFID tags. These tags can store and transmit data wirelessly.

Automated Item Tracking: As customers shop, the RFID tags on the baskets automatically track the items they place in the basket. The RFID readers capture this data in real-time, creating a digital record of the items in each basket.

Seamless Checkout: When customers are ready to check out, they can simply proceed to the checkout counter. The RFID reader at the checkout counter can quickly scan the RFID tags on the baskets, automatically retrieving the item data and generating a detailed bill for the customer.

Enhanced Customer Experience: The smart basket retail system with RFID modules offers a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers. It eliminates the need for manual item scanning at checkout, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

Loss Prevention: The RFID technology in the system also helps with loss prevention by providing real-time alerts when items are removed from the store without being paid for, helping to prevent theft and reduce shrinkage.
